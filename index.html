      <p>"What is an Onawa?"</p>
        <p>“Where’s it from?”</p>
        <p>“What does it mean?”<p>
        <p>“Why did your parents do this to you?”</p>
        <p>These are some of the questions I encounter on a regular basis. My shallow response - mainly that my parents were hippies - although adequate in the moment, is not a sufficient analysis of the meaning, history, and cultural place of my name. To discover the instances that, together, form the historical and cultural meaning behind a name, I’ve begun to learn more about the origins and use of my name to better understand its position in society and better understand it, myself.  I’ve catalogued this journey here.<p>
