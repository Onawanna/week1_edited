    <p>Onawa (the name)</p>
      <p>Pronunciation: oʊ/n/ɔ/wɔ (I think)</p>
      <p>How I pronounce it may not be the original pronunciation but since I have never met another Onawa in my lifetime I am going to continue to think I’m right. Besides, everyone else mispronounces it regardless.</p>

    <p>Origin: Native American - Ojbwe</p>
      <p>Onawa means “wide awake” and is from the Ojibwe language, which is the main native tribe in the Michigan area</p>

      <p>According to SheKnows.com, people named Onawa are “have a deep inner desire to lead, organize, supervise, and to achieve status, power and wealth. They tend to be passionate, compassionate, intuitive, romantic, and to have magnetic personalities. They are usually humanitarian, broadminded and generous, and tend to follow professions where they can serve humanity. Because they are so affectionate and giving, they may be imposed on. They are romantic and easily fall in love, but may be easily hurt and are sometimes quick-tempered.”</p>
