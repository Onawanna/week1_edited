    <p>Onawa Brown Jacket</p>
      <p>A clownish brown jacket for about $43 by the shop, Monday to Sunday. Despite always wanting to own a something with my name on it and not exorbitant cost, I will not be buying this coat.</p>

    <p>Onawa Wedding Dress</p>
      <p>Technically a style of wedding dress sold by Modica. It’s strapless and I’m single so I won’t be buying this either.</p>

    <p>Onawa Painting</p>
      <p>Painting or etching by R.C. Gordman called Onawa. It is not of me.</p>

    <p>Onawa Painting (again)</p>
      <p>Another painting I found while image searching my name. It comes in three sizes and is available on Society6. It’s also not of me but considering the reasonable price point I might buy it?</p>

    <p>Onawa Band</p>
      <p>Based in Asheville North Carolina, it is a band made up of four individuals. Their discography on Bandcamp is from 2013-2015. They have a song called Lakeless Lake House, which sounds like a name that comes straight out of Michigan.</p>
