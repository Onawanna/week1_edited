      <p>Onawa, Iowa</p>

The iconic eskimo pie dessert was created here.This is also the home of a woman named Jody Ewing who has dedicated her life to reporting on Iowa cold cases through her website. This is probably the biggest result when you search “Onawa.” I first heard of it when a childhood friend let me know she had flown over the town. Never have been but it’s on my bucket list - mostly for the name but also the eskimo pie. There are also lots of businesses and organizations named Onawa here, as well, including a library, annual bike ride, and orthodontist.</p>

      <p>Onawa, Maine</p>
        <p>Located in Maine, it’s a mystery how this town ended up with what is a name of Ojibwe origin. Some speculate that it is named after a native girl who committed suicide or maybe it’s just named from the Song of the Hiawatha. There are no photos readily available in search results since what most comes up is the Lake nearby or the train station. I assume the town still exists, though?</p>
