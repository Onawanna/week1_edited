      <p>Song of the Hiawatha</p>
  <p>A poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. This song is credited for the being the source from which both the town in Iowa is named. It is probably the most historical and famous instance of Onawa...and possibly the origin of the name. The name and meaning “awake”, come from a song sang at the wedding feast of the hero, Hiawatha in the poem. The lyrics for the wedding song are as follows:</p>
 <p>"Onaway!  Awake, beloved!</p>
        <p>Thou the wild-flower of the forest!</p>
        <p>Thou the wild-bird of the prairie!</p>
        <p>Thou with eyes so soft and fawn-like!</p>
        <p>"If thou only lookest at me,</p>
        <p>I am happy, I am happy,</p>
        <p>As the lilies of the prairie,</p>
        <p>When they feel the dew upon them!</p>
        <p>"Sweet thy breath is as the fragrance</p>
        <p>Of the wild-flowers in the morning,</p>
        <p>As their fragrance is at evening,</p>
        <p>In the Moon when leaves are falling.</p>
        <p>"Does not all the blood within me</p>
        <p>Leap to meet thee, leap to meet thee,</p>
        <p>As the springs to meet the sunshine,</p>
        <p>In the Moon when nights are brightest?</p>
        <p>"Onaway! my heart sings to thee,</p>
        <p>Sings with joy when thou art near me,</p>
        <p>As the sighing, singing branches</p>
        <p>In the pleasant Moon of Strawberries!</p>
        <p>"When thou art not pleased, beloved,</p>
        <p>Then my heart is sad and darkened,</p>
        <p>As the shining river darkens</p>
        <p>When the clouds drop shadows on it!</p>
        <p>"When thou smilest, my beloved,</p>
        <p>Then my troubled heart is brightened,</p>
        <p>As in sunshine gleam the ripples</p>
        <p>That the cold wind makes in rivers.</p>
        <p>"Smiles the earth, and smile the waters,</p>
        <p>Smile the cloudless skies above us,</p>
        <p>But I lose the way of smiling</p>
        <p>When thou art no longer near me!</p>
        <p>"I myself, myself! behold me!</p>
        <p>Blood of my beating heart, behold me!</p>
        <p>Oh awake, awake, beloved!</p>
        <p>Onaway! awake, beloved!"</p>
